# SequelizeTask-Management-System
## In this task I learnt 4 things:
**Firstly:** _it was about connecting sequelize instead of query boring long method_
**Secondly:** _the code connected with .env was making table everytime I run it , so I used development mode additianolly to the method /code force: true /code_
**3rdly:** _learnt about production and development modes_
**ultimately** _{ alter: true } can potentially cause data loss if you're making significant changes to your models. Always backup your data before making schema changes._
